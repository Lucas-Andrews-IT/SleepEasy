# SleepEasy Discord Bot

This discord bot was intended for server owners that want basic features and their own personal discord bot. It was also created to teach new software developers or someone starting to learn [Python](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language)) the fundamentals and capabilites of python by using discord as an example.

Note: I will eventually add slash commands to the bot to comply with discord bot standards.
